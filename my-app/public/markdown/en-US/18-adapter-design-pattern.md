**Classification**: Structural

The **Adapter** Design Pattern enables incompatible *interfaces* to work together properly.

Note that *interface* here refers to any abstraction (class) available in your system.

## The Problem

Imagine your application receives data in XML format and needs to send this data to a partner service using an external library whose methods expect JSON format.

How can we solve this problem?

## The Solution

Following the example above, since you cannot change the sending class â€” as it comes from a library â€” the idea is to create a wrapper class. This class should provide a method that accepts data in XML format, transforms it into JSON, and then calls the sending method of the library.

In other words, the idea is to create a class that adapts â€” hence the pattern's name â€” the use of other classes that are not inherently compatible.

    <p><strong>Fun Fact</strong>: We use this design pattern even in the real world â€” electrical plugs and sockets can have different standards, but an adapter allows them to work together.</p>
