Let's talk about SDKMan, what this tool is, and the advantages of using it.

## What Is It

[SDKMan](https://sdkman.io/) is an SDK manager. It provides developers with a CLI for installing and configuring various tools such as:

- Java
- Kotlin
- Scala
- Maven
- Gradle

[Click here](https://sdkman.io/sdks) to see the full list.

## Advantages

Without SDKMan, installing any of the previously mentioned dependencies would require a series of installations and commands.

The problem worsens when talking about upgrading to a new version or even switching contexts/versions based on specific needs.

### Example

Imagine a scenario where you have multiple Java projects with different versions. Despite backward compatibility, the ideal approach is to use the correct JDK version for project compilation.

With SDKMan, this becomes easy: just install the required versions and switch between them as needed.
