[Testcontainers](https://testcontainers.com/) is an [open-source library](https://github.com/testcontainers/) that provides instances of any application that can run in a container via Docker for your integration tests.

It manages the entire lifecycle of your container during the test execution, initializing it at the start and shutting it down at the end.

## In Detail

To test your conditional checks and business rule executions, using some *mocks* might be enough.

However, what would you do if you needed to test a complex database query? Or check integration with your messaging service? Or even verify the behavior of your distributed cache service?

Testcontainers enables you to test your application as if it were in the real world, simulating a production-like environment.

In other words, it allows your integrations to be fully tested, ensuring greater reliability in your deliveries.

## How It Works

Here's an initial look at how it works [in Java]:

```java
class MyTest {

  @Container
  static final GenericContainer<?> container = new GenericContainer<>("redis:5.0.3-alpine")
    .withExposedPorts(6379);

}
```
