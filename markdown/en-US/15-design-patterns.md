Hello, welcome to Design Patterns in 1 Minute, a series of texts aimed at explaining the main and most commonly used design patterns of today in 1 minute (or almost that).

## What Is a Design Pattern?

Basically, **design patterns are a standardized way of solving a common problem in software development.**

They can also be considered a best practice in coding, as they improve code readability, reusability, and maintainability — if used correctly.

## When and How to Use Them?

To know when and how to use them, it’s important to become familiar with each pattern and understand its purposes. Stay tuned on [gustavoflor.dev](https://gustavoflor.dev), where I’ll explain each of them weekly.
