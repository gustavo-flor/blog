Hi, my name is Gustavo Flôr, but you can just call me Flôr. I'm 22 years old and work as a senior software engineer at PicPay. In my free time, I'm creating tech content, trying to share the knowledge I've been studying. Feel free to check out my published stories.

This is my first post on this site. I created it with care to serve as a learning journey log. I've always wanted a website with my name, but you know how it is — perfectionism always won. I kept planning an elaborate site with countless features, and when faced with challenges, I would freeze and give up on creating it. Well, this time, that didn’t happen. I started small, with plans to evolve this little corner of mine on the internet bit by bit. Welcome, make yourself at home, and navigate through my experiences with me.

And before I forget... **Hello World**
