## Em detalhes

Now let's see the main definitions and differences between scalability and elasticity...

### Escalabilidade

- Long-term solution
- Ability of the application grow horizontally (adding new containers) or vertically (adding more resources) when it needs
- Usually, in microservices architecture benefits horizontally scale, being able to distribute tasks through N machines
- Manual, planned and predictive
- Pay-as-you-grow

### Elasticidade

- Short-term solution
- Ability of the application to adapt and handle spike throughputs without failures (being elastic)
- The machine have the ability to adapt the resources (memory, cpu, etc.) automatically to match the workload
- Maintain performance through the time
- Auto-scaling is an example of elasticity
- Automatic, unplanned and reactive
- Pay-as-you-need

## Moral história

|           | Escalabilidade | Elasticidade |
| --------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| Definição |                |              |
| Uso       |                |              |
| Custo     |                |              |
